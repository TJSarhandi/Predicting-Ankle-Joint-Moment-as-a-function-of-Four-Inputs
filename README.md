# Predicting-Ankle-Joint-Moment-as-a-function-of-Four-Inputs
The goal of the neural network is to predict the ankle joint moment as a function of the vertical ground reaction force, hip joint angle, knee joint angle, and ankle joint angle. The neural network would do this prediction for each time point.
